# CalorieMonitor

My Calorie Monitor app is an app that tracks the daily calories taken with recommandations to fitness. It can calculate the BMI, BMR, recommended calorie plans, search record calories and save to the record, checking your meal histories by date, and provide some helpful articles about fitness.

If you start the app, there would be no sharedpreferences file. So you will need to calculate through the first button, then you will get a report. Then you can scroll down and choose the plan that fits you most. If you do not select anything, there would be no data saved.

After selecting a plan, if you go back to the main activity, you would find other buttons showed up. From those, you can record the calories for each meal, you can checkout the food items and calories you had on difference days, and you can delete them from the list too. 

When you record, you can hit "Wanna search..?" button to search food calories, and add them to record.

You can also read some helpful articles from the fourth button. There are some feeds you can select about fitness. You can change feeds through the menu.
